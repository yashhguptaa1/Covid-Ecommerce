So when a user logs in using whatever service we use, whether it's Google sigin or email and password,
we want to store that on the App.js State so that we can pass it into components that need it because we
want to access our current user object throughout our application.
  
So normally how we fetch data before is we inside of our .
Method component did mount.
We're used to firing a fetch api to the back end to fetch data, but this is only a one off thing.
Once the code calls fetch, it won't come back again until a component did Mount Life-cycle method gets
called again.
But we don't want to remount our app.
We just want to always know when Firebase has realized that the authentication state has changed.
