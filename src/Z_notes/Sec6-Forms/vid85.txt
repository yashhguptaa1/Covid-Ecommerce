If this was our Login page and this was our 
sign in component and this is our register component
where should the state live?

Ready for the answer?

The easiest way to think about this is to lift up the state only up to the
point that the components needed.
So when we create this component.
We're going to actually keep the state in its own individual component, so sign in is going to have
its own state and register is going to have its own state.
Why is that?
Well, because these two things don't need to talk to each other, sign in, doesn't really care what
we enter and register and register, doesn't care what's in the form of sign in.
So if we lifted the state up and kept the state in the entire page every time we update this.
And the state changes.
Both of these would get we rendered.
So that means two extra calculations that react has to do to render this and 
we render sigin if we kept state just in the signin, 
because that's the only place that we care about those changes,
