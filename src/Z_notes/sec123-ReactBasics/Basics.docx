It's what the browser uses to display a Web Site or a web app, and Javascript is simply manipulating

this Dom.

That's all javascript is doing.

This is what libraries did you either did this manually or you used jQuery or you use some sort of

a library that allows you to use this in a simple fashion you see this way of programming was called

imperative: that is in an imperative paradigm you directly change individual parts of your app in response

to various user events. so you had let's say your javascript file you'd say: hey if user is logged in.

So React says: hey you know what.

Let me take care that I'll find the best way for me to change the Dom and just declare to me what your

app looks like.

So all we need to do is say hey this is a javascript object of how I want the app to look and React

is going to hold this javascript object this massive massive blueprint of how things should look.

And based on this blueprint that we give it React just says hey just tell me what the page should

look like and I'll take care of it.

I'll do everything for you.

I'll find the best way to use the DOM.

You're never going to touch the DOM.

Just tell me what the page should look like.

This declarative paradigm is called that because we declare that hey this is what the state or data

of our app should be like.
